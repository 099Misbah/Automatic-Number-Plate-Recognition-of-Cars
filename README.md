Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)
This project implements an AI-powered system to recognize car number plates from images or videos using deep learning. The model, based on Inception ResNetV2, effectively detects and extracts text from license plates under various conditions, including different lighting and occlusions.

Key Features:

Dataset: 453 annotated images of vehicles with visible license plates.

Model: Inception ResNetV2, leveraging pre-trained weights for enhanced accuracy.

Challenges Tackled: Variability in plate formats, motion blur, and noisy images.

Performance: Successfully detects license plate text with confidence scores, showcasing robust recognition capabilities.
